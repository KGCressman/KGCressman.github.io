It is gonna look a little empty here for a bit, but once I get a hang of the new markdown language and decide what should go here, there will be lots more stuff to see!

I am a recent grad currently job hunting, so if you want to know what im doing that isn't building this site, [check me out Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cressman-611a5517b/)

I am also a huge Magic nerd, so heres a link to [My Cube](https://www.cubetutor.com/cubeblog/27172)





## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KGCressman/KGCressman.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KGCressman/KGCressman.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
